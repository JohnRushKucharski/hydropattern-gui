description: Check out an unblocked AFK GitHub issue, implement the fix via TDD, run a quality review loop, and submit a pull request for human review. Use when asked to work on, fix, or resolve a GitHub issue.

# Fix Issue

Autonomously resolve a single AFK GitHub issue: select it, gate on complexity, implement via TDD, review, and submit a pull request.

Read `CONTEXT.md` and all `docs/adr/*.md` before touching any code. Use the project's domain vocabulary in all names. Respect every ADR in the area you are touching, and flag conflicts explicitly rather than silently overriding.

---

## Phase A — Issue Acquisition

### 1. List candidates

```bash
gh issue list --label ready-for-agent --state open \
  --json number,title,body,labels \
  --jq '[.[] | {number, title, body, labels: [.labels[].name]}]'
```

> **If `gh` is not available**: use the `github-pull-request_doSearch` tool with query `is:issue is:open label:ready-for-agent repo:owner/name`. Always include the `repo:` qualifier — the tool searches all repos by default. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` for the full fallback table.

All issues returned by this query are AFK by definition — `ready-for-agent` means AFK (see `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`).

### 2. Verify no unresolved blockers

For each candidate, parse the `## Blocked by` section. For every issue number listed (e.g. `#12`):

```bash
gh issue view 12 --json state --jq '.state'
```

> **If `gh` is not available**: use `github-pull-request_issue_fetch` with `issueNumber: 12`; check the `.state` field of the returned object.

Keep only candidates where every blocker returns `CLOSED` (or the section reads "None — can start immediately").

### 3. Select and confirm *(HITL checkpoint)*

Present the top eligible issue to the user:

```
Selected issue #N: {title}
Blocked by: {summary}

Proceed? (yes / no / pick a different issue)
```

**Stop here and wait for confirmation.** Do not write any code until the user confirms. If the user declines, repeat with the next eligible issue or stop if none remain.

---

## Phase B — Branch, Exploration, and Complexity Gate

### 1. Create a branch

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b fix/{number}-{5-word-kebab-slug}
```

The slug is derived from the issue title: lowercase, spaces → hyphens, max 5 words, no special characters.

### 2. Explore

- Read `CONTEXT.md` and all `docs/adr/*.md` in full.
- Run semantic searches and targeted file reads to map every source file and test file touched by the issue's acceptance criteria.
- Do not guess — confirm your understanding of the affected modules before proceeding.

### 3. Complexity gate *(before writing any code)*

Assess the issue against these thresholds:

| Signal | Threshold | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Acceptance criteria count | > 5 | Too complex |
| Distinct unrelated modules affected | > 3 | Too complex |
| Requires an ADR decision or new architectural component | Any | Too complex |

If **any threshold is triggered**:

1. Delete the branch: `git checkout main && git branch -D fix/{number}-{slug}`
2. Report your complexity findings to the user in plain language.
3. Recommend using the `to-issues` skill to break the issue into smaller child issues.
4. **Stop. Do not write any code.**

If all thresholds pass, continue to Phase C.

### 4. Core behavior-change gate *(before writing any code)*

If the issue changes baseline behavior in computational logic or parser/input normalization, convert this run to HITL execution:

1. Explicitly flag the issue as core behavior-affecting.
2. Continue implementation, but do not commit or open a PR until human approval is obtained.
3. Prepare a Behavior Delta Report before the approval checkpoint.

Initial trigger paths for this gate:

- `hydropattern/patterns.py`
- `hydropattern/parsers.py`

---

## Phase C — TDD Implementation

Follow the `tdd` skill's red-green-refactor loop. Work through the acceptance criteria one at a time as vertical tracer bullets — not horizontal slices.

```
For each acceptance criterion:
  RED:   Write one failing test that specifies the behavior
  GREEN: Write the minimal implementation to make it pass
  CHECK: uv run pytest tests/ -v --tb=short   ← must stay green
  REFACTOR: improve without breaking tests
```

**Rules**
- All test names and interface vocabulary must match `CONTEXT.md` domain terms.
- Tests must exercise public interfaces only — never internal methods or private state.
- Never use `None` where a Null Object is correct (ADR-0003).
- Physical fields on `BaseReservoir` (`outlets`, `pools`, `capacity`, `mappings`) are frozen after construction (ADR-0002). Do not mutate them.
- Plugin registration follows the three-tier pattern in ADR-0001.

**Run the test suite after every GREEN step.** If a previously passing test breaks, fix it before moving on.

---

## Phase D — Review Loop

Run this loop up to **3 times**, or until only MINOR issues remain — whichever comes first.

### Each iteration

#### 1. python-code-review checklist

- PEP 8: line length ≤ 88 chars (ruff default), 4-space indentation, two blank lines between top-level definitions
- Every public symbol has a complete type annotation
- Import order: stdlib → third-party → local, each group separated by a blank line
- Consistent string quoting within each file
- No bare `except:` or `except Exception:` without re-raise

#### 2. SOLID audit

- **SRP**: each class and function has one reason to change
- **OCP**: new behaviors added by extension (new class / strategy), not mutation
- **LSP**: subtypes and protocol implementations are fully substitutable
- **ISP**: protocols are thin — no fat interfaces clients must partially implement
- **DIP**: depend on abstractions (protocols), not concrete classes

#### 2a. Architecture integrity and module-depth audit

- Change must not degrade overall architecture clarity.
- Avoid introducing shallow pass-through modules or unclear interfaces.
- Preserve or improve seam clarity and locality.
- Keep adapters thin: domain/computational logic must not leak into CLI/GUI orchestration.

#### 2b. Complexity and organization audit

- No mega-functions or god classes introduced.
- Keep control flow and conditionals understandable.
- Avoid speculative abstractions and impossible-condition checks.
- Apply DRY with judgment; do not over-abstract before stable repetition.

#### 3. ADR compliance
- Every change must comply with all ADRs in `docs/adr/` relevant to the touched modules. For example, if you change anything in `patterns.py`, you must comply with ADR-0002 (reservoir design) and ADR-0003 (null object pattern).

#### 4. TDD validation

- Every changed or added behavior has at least one test
- Tests describe behavior ("reservoir spills when storage exceeds capacity"), not implementation
- No test reaches into private attributes or internal methods

#### 5. Full validation suite

```bash
uv run ruff check src/
uv run pylint src/ tests/ --output-format=text
uv run mypy src/
uv run pytest tests/ --cov=src/canteen --cov-report=term-missing
```

All four commands must exit 0. Pylint warnings must be resolved or suppressed in `.pylintrc` with a written justification comment. Never use inline `# pylint: disable` to silence a warning without first checking whether it reflects a genuine code smell.

#### 6. Classify findings

| Severity | Criteria | Must fix before PR? |
|---|---|---|
| CRITICAL | Correctness bug; security flaw; test suite failure | Yes |
| MAJOR | SOLID violation; ADR breach; missing type annotation on public symbol | Yes |
| MODERATE | PEP 8 violation; missing test for changed behavior; poor naming | Yes |
| MINOR | Style preference; optional improvement; cosmetic | No — report in PR body |

#### 7. Fix and iterate

Fix every CRITICAL, MAJOR, and MODERATE finding. Then run the next iteration. After 3 iterations (or when only MINORs remain), exit the loop.

### Core behavior-change approval checkpoint *(required when applicable)*

Before Phase E, if core computational/parser baseline behavior changed, present a concise Behavior Delta Report and wait for explicit user approval.

Required report contents:

1. What changed in behavior.
2. Which behavior is correct/better (new vs baseline), with rationale; baseline may remain winner.
3. One focused synthetic test case demonstrating the delta.
4. Regression risk notes.
5. Affected code locations.

Also create and commit a behavior-delta artifact file using:

- Folder: `docs/review/behavior-deltas/`
- Filename: `issue-<number>-<short-slug>.md`

Do not commit, push, or open a PR until approval is granted.

---

## Phase E — PR Submission

### 1. Single commit

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "fix(#${number}): ${issue_title}"
```

One commit per issue. Do not squash or amend after this point.

### 2. Push

```bash
git push origin fix/${number}-${slug}
```

### 3. Create the pull request

```bash
gh pr create \
  --title "fix(#${number}): ${issue_title}" \
  --body "$(cat <<'PREOF'
